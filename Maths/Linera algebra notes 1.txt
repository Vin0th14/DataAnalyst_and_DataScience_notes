Linera algebra 

Scalar - magnitude - eg..weight,height,any numbers,speed

Vector(Directon) - travelled in 40 km/hr in south direction - south is vector pointing towards direction

vector = AB>  [ > - Above arrow mark]  - It is always magnitute and direction
scalar = AB

Types of vector

Zero vector - vector with zero magnitude [car parked at location]
unit vector - vector with magnitute is 1 unit
coinitial vector - 2 or more start from same point
colinear vector - 2 or more lying on parallel line
Equal  vectors - 2 or more in same  magnitute and direction
unequal vector - 2 or more in diffrent  magnitute and same direction
Negative vector - vector with same magnitute with opposite direction


Add and subtract vectors

Two methods [Triangle and Parallelogram]

Triangle - a>+b>=(a>+b>)
Parallelogram - AB>=a>  BC>=b>  then AB>+BC>=(a>+b>)

Triangle - a>-b>=(a>+(-b>))


Properties 

1) Commutative - u>+v> = v>+u>
2) Associative -(u>+v>)+w>=u>+(v>+w>)
3) Existence of Identity - v>+0>=v>
4) Additive inverse property - v>+(-v>)=0>


Co ordinate system

i>=1 unit in x direction
j>=1 unit in y direction
k>=1 unit in z direction

AB> [Resultant vector ]=3i>+4j> [component vector]
